# ezvps

A bash TUI/CLI VPS manager for **Debian 13**, run as **root**. One script, no
extra dependencies.

> **Status: v0.0.1 in development.** **L2TP** and **3x-ui** work so far. The
> other menu items (Backpack, ctunnel, Nginx, Certificates, Lazyports, SSH and
> Users, Firewall, Backup, Check For Updates, Uninstall) are still pending:
> they print "not implemented yet" and return to the menu. They arrive in
> later releases, one module per PR. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ezvps
cd ezvps
sudo bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` copies the script to `/usr/local/bin/ezvps`. It is safe to
re-run: an identical install is left alone, a changed one is backed up to
`/var/backups/ezvps/` before being replaced. An existing ezl2tp install is
never touched.

## Use

```bash
sudo ezvps            # interactive menu
sudo ezvps l2tp       # jump straight to a module
ezvps --version
ezvps --help
```

Menu:

```
 1) L2TP
 2) 3x-ui
 3) Backpack
 4) ctunnel
 5) Nginx
 6) Certificates
 7) Lazyports
 8) SSH and Users
 9) Firewall
10) Backup
11) Check For Updates
12) Uninstall
 0) Exit
```

### L2TP

* If the `ezl2tp` command is installed, ezvps launches it and brings you
  back to the menu when it exits.
* If not, ezvps prints instructions to install it from its **private**
  repository with `git clone` and your own GitHub authentication, then
  returns to the menu. ezvps never downloads that repo anonymously and does
  not bundle the ezl2tp installer.

### 3x-ui

`ezvps` -> `2` opens a submenu:

```
 1) Install 3x-ui
 2) Install with 3x-ui self installer
 3) Status
 4) Restart
 5) Panel info
 6) Change password
 0) Back
```

* **Install 3x-ui** downloads the official [3x-ui](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui)
  installer at a **pinned release tag** (`v3.11.0`), shows the URL and its
  SHA-256, verifies the hash and asks before running it (nothing is piped into
  a shell). It then sets port `3389`, user `admin`, password `Admin123`, path
  `xuipanel` and no certificate with the panel's own settings command, and
  checks that the panel answers on that port and path. If a panel already
  exists, its config is backed up first and you are asked before its settings
  are overwritten.
* **Install with 3x-ui self installer** launches the same pinned official
  installer interactively; it asks its own questions and ezvps forces nothing.
* **Status**, **Restart** (only the `x-ui` service), **Panel info** and
  **Change password** (through the panel's own settings command, then a panel
  restart; the new password is never printed, logged or stored).

> **Change the password right after a default install.** `admin` / `Admin123`
> is a well-known default and the default panel runs on plain HTTP (no TLS).
> ezvps prints this warning after every default install: use
> `3x-ui -> Change password` immediately.

The exact source URL, pin and behaviour are in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) section 6.2.

## Principles

Check before installing. Back up before overwriting. Idempotent re-runs. No
hardcoded secrets. No real IPs, secrets or usernames in this repo (tests use
fake data only).

## Development

```bash
bash tests/lint.sh          # bash -n + shellcheck + hygiene scan
bash tests/smoke-test.sh    # menu, L2TP stub, 3x-ui against a fake panel CLI, pending modules, installer
```

VPS. Contributor and agent rules are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
