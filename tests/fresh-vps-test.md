# Fresh VPS test (manual)

Run on a **throwaway Debian 13 VPS**, as root, before merging changes that
touch the installer or a module. Use fake data only; do not paste real IPs,
tokens or usernames into notes or issues. Placeholders: `<owner>`,
`192.0.2.10`, `example.com`, `testuser`.

Tick each box; note failures with the exact output.

## 0. Prerequisites

- [ ] `cat /etc/os-release` shows Debian 13
- [ ] `id -u` prints `0`
- [ ] `git` is available (`git --version`); if not, `apt-get install -y git`
- [ ] `command -v ezvps` prints nothing (clean start)
- [ ] Note whether `command -v ezl2tp` finds anything (this decides section 3)

## 1. Fresh install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ezvps && cd ezvps
bash tests/lint.sh        # optional here; needs shellcheck
bash tests/smoke-test.sh
bash install.sh
```

- [ ] smoke test: `0 failed`
- [ ] `install.sh` exits 0 and prints `Installed ezvps to /usr/local/bin/ezvps`
- [ ] `ls -l /usr/local/bin/ezvps` shows mode `-rwxr-xr-x`, owner root
- [ ] `ezvps --version` prints `ezvps 0.0.1-dev`
- [ ] `ezvps --help` prints usage

## 2. Re-run safety

```bash
bash install.sh
echo '# local edit' >> /usr/local/bin/ezvps
bash install.sh
ls /var/backups/ezvps/
```

- [ ] first re-run prints `already up to date` and creates no backup
- [ ] after the local edit, install.sh prints `Backed up existing ...`
- [ ] exactly one `ezvps.<timestamp>.<pid>` backup exists and contains `# local edit`
- [ ] `cmp ezvps /usr/local/bin/ezvps` reports no difference

## 3. L2TP

**3a. ezl2tp NOT installed**

- [ ] `ezvps` -> `1` shows "ezl2tp is not installed" plus git clone instructions
- [ ] instructions mention the private repo and authentication; no raw download command
- [ ] after Enter, the menu is shown again; `0` exits with status 0

**3b. ezl2tp installed** (install it yourself via the git clone route; do not
script it from ezvps)

- [ ] `ezvps` -> `1` prints `Launching ezl2tp...` and ezl2tp's own menu opens
- [ ] leaving ezl2tp prints `Returned to ezvps.` and the ezvps menu returns
- [ ] re-run `bash install.sh`: output says `ezl2tp found; left untouched.`
      and `sha256sum "$(command -v ezl2tp)"` is the same before and after

## 4. Menu and not-yet-implemented modules

- [ ] menu lines match exactly (no description text):
      `L2TP, 3x-ui, Backpack, ctunnel, Nginx, Certificates, Lazyports,
      SSH and Users, Firewall, Backup, Check For Updates, Uninstall`, then `0) Exit`
- [ ] each of `2` to `12` prints `<Label> is not implemented yet.` and
      returns to the menu after Enter
- [ ] `abc`, `13`, empty input -> `Invalid choice`, menu continues
- [ ] `ezvps nginx` (and the other keys) print the same message, exit 0
- [ ] `ezvps bogus` prints usage, exit 2
- [ ] Ctrl-D at the prompt exits cleanly

## 5. Non-root

- [ ] as a normal user: `ezvps` prints `ezvps must be run as root.`, exit 1
- [ ] as a normal user: `ezvps --version` still works

## 6. Cleanup (no uninstall module yet)

```bash
rm -f /usr/local/bin/ezvps
rm -rf /var/backups/ezvps
```

- [ ] ezl2tp (if present) still works after cleanup

Destroy the VPS when finished.
